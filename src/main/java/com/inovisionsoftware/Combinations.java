/*
 * A formula for the number of possible combinations of r objects from a set of n objects. 
 * This is written in any of the ways shown below.
 * (n)                           n
 * (r)   or  nCr  or C(n,r) or C
 *                               r
 * 
 * All forms are read aloud "n choose r."
 * 
 * Formula = n!/(r! (n-r)!) = (n(n-1)(n-2) .... (n-r+1) ) / r!
 * 
 * Observe that nCr = nPr/r!
 * 
 * Example: 	

How many different committees of 4 students can be chosen from a group of 15?

There are 15C4 possible combinations of 4 students from a set of 15.
15!/(4! x 11!) = 15 x 14 x 13 x 12 / 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 1365 committees
